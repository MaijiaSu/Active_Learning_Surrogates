# Active_Learning_Surrogates
This project provides Matlab codes about surrogate modeling for full probability estimation, involved in the following paper: 

Su, M., Wang, Z., Bursi, O.S. and Broccardo, M., 2025. Surrogate modeling for probability distribution estimation: uniform or adaptive design?. Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety, 261, p.111059. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2025.111059](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2025.111059)

## How to start?
1. Before running the script main_SingleExample.m, please ensure that the required surrogate modeling toolboxes are installed, including:
   - DACE: A MATLAB Kriging Toolbox, Version 2.0. Available from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU): [link](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/projects/dace/)
   - ooDACE: An object-oriented extension of the DACE toolbox. Developed by the SUMO Lab at imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven: [link](https://sumo.ilabt.imec.be/home/software/oodace)
   - UQLab: Uncertainty Quantification Laboratory. Developed by the Chair of Risk, Safety & Uncertainty Quantification, ETH Zurich: [link](https://www.uqlab.com/)
1. Run the script main_AllBechmarks.m to replicate the results in our paper
